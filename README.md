## Installation

Get Stylus, its available on most web browsers to my knowledge, but i will leave the main 2 browsers people use down here

# Chrome

# Firefox

Note:
> You could also use other UserCSS extensions, although the one that will make it easier, and the one that has worked the best for me is Stylus

To install any theme its as easy as just going down, and clicking the blue #Install button
