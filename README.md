## Installation

Get Stylus, its available on most web browsers to my knowledge, but i will leave the main 2 browsers people use down here

# [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)

# [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

Note:
> You could also use other UserCSS extensions, although the one that will make it easier, and the one that has worked the best for me is Stylus
